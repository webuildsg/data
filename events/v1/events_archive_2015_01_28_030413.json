In addition, you will also get to hear more about how IT can help you increase your sales systematically for a tech company. Speaker Bio: Who would think that a exchange student would develop a winter product after just being on exchange in a winter country. But 3 years back, Charmain Tan did so. She invented and commercialized a winter touchscreen gloves as she could not use her newly bought iphone in the midst of the winter. It was indeed a great innovation as validated by the various international awards (eg. Red Dot Design Award, International Invention Award-Gold) that her company acclaimed for the invention. But great innovation needs to be coupled with great sales for the growth of a company. Hence as she was enroute to starting her second, she wanted to build something that could help companies increase their sales so entrepreneurs would not walk the same path that she did. Together with some great partners who are talented at Sales, Operations and Technology respectively, she started her second earlier this year Register Now! Sign up now to listen to how this young and crazy lady blend sales and technology in her new startup, developed a market-ready product in 2 months & scale it to profitability in less than 6 months.","location":"Plug-In@Blk71","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/775573215852270","group_name":"Hackers and Painters","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/326203847521210","formatted_time":"30 Jan 2015, Fri, 12:00 pm","start_time":"2015-01-30T04:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-27T18:44:55.843Z"},{"id":"15384757223","name":"\"A Quantum City: How to Master the Generic?\" @Urban Lab","description":"What if cities were not connected in space and time?

In 2012, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to research on genetically induced adult stem cells for “advancing therapy”. This has led to the unprecedented growth in the arena of regenerative medicine using patients’ own cells. As we see a dwindling number of approved small molecule drugs and rising promises of biologics, can we ride on the wave of cell therapy as the next blockbuster or personalised therapeutics? Biotech Connection Singapore brings you a panel of key opinion figures in the Singapore cell therapy community, as we discuss the opportunities and challenges of translating stem cell research into clinical applications.    \n-          Are our technologies ready to develop the ideal candidate for cell-based therapy possessing characteristics such as accessibility, ease of scaling up, long tern safety profile and autologous in nature, etc? \n-          In terms of business models, is Singapore going to stagnate at the level of cord blood banking instead of leading the frontier of cell therapy?  \n-          Japan, Korea and China have emerged as the strong contenders in the development of cell therapy. Is our regulatory framework sufficiently established to administer cell therapy trials locally?  \n-          How do we prevent non-compliant clinical practices which put desperate patients at risks? \n  \nProgramme \n6:30 – 7:00 PM               Registration \n 7:00 – 7:10 PM               BCS & Speaker Introduction   \n7:10 – 8:30 PM               Panel Discussion and Q&A   \n8:30 – 9:30 PM               Networking Reception \n  \nOur Speakers \n  \nProf. James Hui  \nHead & Senior Consultant, Division of Paediatric Orthopaedics \nDirector, Cartilage Repair Program, National University Health System, Singapore \n  \n  \n  \nProf. James Hui specializes in the management of orthopaedic problems in children, as well as general orthopaedics.
