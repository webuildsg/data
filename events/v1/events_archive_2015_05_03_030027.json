Register on the day. On 8 and 9 May 2015, ArtScience Museum will host a conference exploring the legacy of history's most celebrated artist and scientist, Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519). This conference will explore da Vinci's way of thinking and the cultural landscape which nurtured him. It will analyse how his interdisciplinary approach, which we now refer to as “systems thinking” and \"complexity\", remains resonant for us today, and if and how it can be applied within the fields of art, science, technology, education and futures thinking. The conference has been co-convened by Honor Harger and Anna Salaman (ArtScience Museum), and Andrea Nanetti (Nanyang Technological University, School of Art, Design and Media). Thursday 7 May 2015, 7pm – 10pm ArtScience Late will feature a special performance from, our international ArtScience resident, Maurizio Martinucci (TeZ). The show is free, and there will be performances at 8pm and 9pm. For more, see: https://www.facebook.com/events/628941177236899/ Friday 8 May 2015, 10am – 6pm The first full day of the conference presents Leonardo da Vinci and the approach that he took to all of his lines of enquiries. It analyses how da Vinci not only understood the essence of ‘systems thinking’, but how he also applied this to his inventions, ideas and work generally. We will explore if there was something within the context of da Vinci’s time which encouraged his thinking and ‘systems’ awareness, or if his approach was a one-off. We will ask if there are there other examples of interdisciplinary thinking and approaches throughout history. The day will continue with a reflection on the more recent times and the advent of new media – a marriage of two seemingly quite separate, established disciplines: art and technology, moving the dialogue into the 20th century, and beyond.

It will cover how science and technology environments might nurture the \"Leonardos\" of tomorrow and stimulate interdisciplinary working, and look at innovative education and pedagogical methodologies today which will encourage the same. Fittingly, the last session looks to the future. Curated by Forum for the Future, it addresses how complex problems of this time may be solved using multidisciplinary and the ‘systems’, or ‘complexity theory’ approaches.

As such, Alex and I are organising a series of tutorials on the top data mining algorithms. The content of the talks will aim to cover a little understanding of the theory, but will mostly focus on examples with R. The 8 - 10 algorithms we aim to cover include: • k-means • SVM • Apriori • Naive Bayes • Random forests and decision/regression trees • EM • kNN • AdaBoost We intend for the sessions to be held on a monthly basis, lasting about an hour or so. The venue will be 237 South Bridge Road. We’ll have to collect SGD 5 a head, but this goes toward the venue and refreshments (not into our pockets =)). We'll collect it at the door on the day itself. The speakers for the talks will be our very own RUGS members. If you are an expert in one of the topics and would like to conduct the session, do let us know! For the first talk, Alex will be speaking about SVM. Here is a short overview of the talk, and a little bit about Alex too About SVM: SVM is nowadays one of the most popular classification algorithms. It is efficient in dealing big data set. It allows us to fit nonlinear classification boundary with kernel methods. Moreover, the combination of penalization and “customized” kernel enable us to introduce prior knowledge into classification. In this R share session, we will quickly go through the theoretical part of SVM, and demonstrate the application with R package “kernlab”. And last but not least, we will show 2 examples to let you feel the power of SVM. About Alex: I am a statistician in HSOR@NHG. I have been studying statistics for 6 years and using R for 6 years. My research areas are statistical learning, computing statistics, data visualization and data science with population health management.
