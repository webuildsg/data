Join us this Friday to find out how Charmain hybrids IT and Sales and how she manages the twist between Sales People and Engineers? In addition, you will also get to hear more about how IT can help you increase your sales systematically for a tech company. Speaker Bio: Who would think that a exchange student would develop a winter product after just being on exchange in a winter country. But 3 years back, Charmain Tan did so. She invented and commercialized a winter touchscreen gloves as she could not use her newly bought iphone in the midst of the winter. It was indeed a great innovation as validated by the various international awards (eg. Red Dot Design Award, International Invention Award-Gold) that her company acclaimed for the invention. But great innovation needs to be coupled with great sales for the growth of a company. Hence as she was enroute to starting her second, she wanted to build something that could help companies increase their sales so entrepreneurs would not walk the same path that she did. Together with some great partners who are talented at Sales, Operations and Technology respectively, she started her second earlier this year Register Now! Sign up now to listen to how this young and crazy lady blend sales and technology in her new startup, developed a market-ready product in 2 months & scale it to profitability in less than 6 months.","location":"Plug-In@Blk71","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/775573215852270","group_name":"Hackers and Painters","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/326203847521210","formatted_time":"30 Jan 2015, Fri, 12:00 pm","start_time":"2015-01-30T04:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-28T18:40:30.592Z"},{"id":"15384757223","name":"\"A Quantum City: How to Master the Generic?\" @Urban Lab","description":"What if cities were not connected in space and time?

One is on software (databases), the other one is on hardware (Bluetooth), and both speakers are named Cedric. What are the chances? See you there! Free pizza is served before the talks. Location: NUS Hackerspace - The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Needs To Know About Database Indexes by Cedric Chin -- Talk description If you’re a software developer, it’s nearly guaranteed that you’ve worked with a database before. But what happens when you find your queries running slowly? How do you debug bad database performance? The truth is, most of us don’t know much about RDMS internals: we just insert and retrieve data and pray that our queries run quickly enough. The good news? It turns out that the only thing a developer really needs to understand about relational databases is how their indexes work. Most of the performance characteristics of modern RDMSes may be explained through the database index. This talk introduces the data structures these indexes use, how these structures determine query performance, how to read a query plan, and what to think about when designing indexes for your database schema. -- Speaker profile Cedric Chin is a product manager at Floating Cube Studios, a mobile development agency located in Singapore and Ho Chi Minh City. He likes Python, Go, green tea and cats. In a previous life, he interned at Viki and Kicksend and ran the NUS Hackers. - TWI, a Bluetooth Low Energy Wireless Motion Sensor by Cedric Honnet -- Talk description from the speaker What? The TWI, Tangible Wireless IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), is a wireless motion sensor. It is optimized to be ultra low power and tiny, 1 in x 1 in (2.5 cm x 2.5 cm). TWI is basically composed with an ultra compact 9 axis IMU from Invensense, the MPU-9150 and a BLE cortex M0 from Nordic Semi, the nRF51822. How? To make the PCB, you can get the gerbers from the OSHpark widget, or you can get the latest version from upverter. It's still a prototype but a detailed bill of material is available here: goo.gl/8yxCDU I developed the PCB using Upverter so feel free to fork it and improve it! Similarly, feel free to fork the Github repo and play with the software... Enjoy ;) -- Speaker profile Cedric Honnet holds a Masters in Embedded Systems from ParisTech, France. He is always enthusiastic about anything at the intersections between Arts and interHacktivity. He has been a Noisebridge addict since 2012, and has taken over the circuit hacking workshops when Mich wasn't in town. Passionate by music and DJing since the age of 14 (~1995), he started tinkering with electronics and computers when building his own home studio. He gave up school quite early to focus on concrete things such as music or computer hacking, and decided to go back after a few years to advance his understanding of technology. During his engineering studies, he also went to hackerspaces to explore more about physical computing and interactivity. He worked as firmware engineer and interHacktivist at Sifteo in San Francisco, then co-founded tangib.ly, where he gets to play as in a hackerspace. He got to develop musical instruments, virtual reality bike systems, interactive art, and many other Open Source projects. He is now working on twiz.io, a Tiny Wireless IMU (motion sensor) that controls music, light, fire, etc. It gives a life to everyday objects, enables people's motion and builds a bridge from the tangible to the digital world.

In 2012, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to research on genetically induced adult stem cells for “advancing therapy”. This has led to the unprecedented growth in the arena of regenerative medicine using patients’ own cells. As we see a dwindling number of approved small molecule drugs and rising promises of biologics, can we ride on the wave of cell therapy as the next blockbuster or personalised therapeutics? Biotech Connection Singapore brings you a panel of key opinion figures in the Singapore cell therapy community, as we discuss the opportunities and challenges of translating stem cell research into clinical applications.    \n-          Are our technologies ready to develop the ideal candidate for cell-based therapy possessing characteristics such as accessibility, ease of scaling up, long tern safety profile and autologous in nature, etc? \n-          In terms of business models, is Singapore going to stagnate at the level of cord blood banking instead of leading the frontier of cell therapy?  \n-          Japan, Korea and China have emerged as the strong contenders in the development of cell therapy.
