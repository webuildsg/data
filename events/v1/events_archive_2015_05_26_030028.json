Julia is fast becoming the de facto language of technical computing and is finding new applications every day such as in databases and embedded systems. This workshop will introduce the language and also present use cases for technical computing, statistics, big data applications, high performance, and in education. The workshop, aimed at professionals, researchers, and students, will illustrate how Julia's ease-of-use and fast execution go hand in hand. Upon completion of this workshop, attendees will understand what Julia has to offer over other open source systems such as Python, R, and even commercial systems as well. Julia’s dynamic system allows for scalable fault-tolerant cloud based systems. Examples of Julia running in the cloud will be provided. We will explain Julia’s design including multiple dispatch and the sophisticated type system, and why engineers, scientists, and statisticians can benefit from these concepts. Julia offers a solution to the \"two-language problem\" whereby one wastefully prototypes in one (slower) language and then deploys in another (faster) language. \nThe second part of the tutorial will cover OpenTuner, a open source framework for building domain-specific multi-objective program autotuners, a simple way for improving the performance and efficiency of high performance applications. High performance applications have many tunable parameters. Finding the right values for these parameters for a given architecture is a challenge for many programmers. OpenTuner is a machine learning based framework that provides a simple workflow to find good configurations for even very complex parameter spaces. OpenTuner has been used by a number of different projects to build domain specific autotuners. We will also demonstrate available autotuners for the JVM and gcc that can give an immediate and significant performance boost for existing applications. \n\n\n\n\n  \nAlan Edelman\nMIT Mathematics and CSAIL\nProfessor\n\n\n  \nJiahao Chen\nMIT CSAIL\nResearch Scientist\n\n\n  \nSaman P Amarasinghe\nMIT EECS and CSAIL\nProfessor\n\n\n\n","location":"Stephen Riady Centre LT50 (Level 1), , University Town, 2 College Avenue West, Singapore 138607, Singapore null","url":"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/tutorial-on-high-performance-cloud-computing-technologies-julia-opentuner-tickets-4866645267?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Alan Edelman, Saman P.

And, since the first release of the BayesiaLab software package in 2001, practitioners have been able to leverage this powerful paradigm for their research without having to write a single line of code. \nLearn what the Bayesian networks revolution is all about, and join Stefan Conrady and Dr. Lionel Jouffe for a complimentary workshop on knowledge discovery with Bayesian networks and BayesiaLab. In the presentation, we will first lay out the basics of the Bayesian network formalism and then illustrate a practical application in a live software demo. \nTarget Audience: \nApplied researchers, statisticians, data scientists, data miners, biologists, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, predictive modelers, econometricians, economists, engineers, market researchers, knowledge managers, marketing scientists, social scientists, students and teachers in related fields.

You will see that Bayesian networks are ideally suited to model a wide range of high-dimensional problem domains. Overall, this course's focus in on leveraging Bayesian networks for applied research, with the objective of solving problems that currently appear difficult or intractable with traditional statistical methods. \nThis \"short course\" is a compact version of the highly acclaimed 3-Day Introductory BayesiaLab Course, which we have been offering around the world for almost ten years. We have designed this new 2-day course for scientists who are interested in utilizing Bayesian networks for their research, but for whom the current 3-day program might be too much of a time commitment. \nThroughout this course, we exclusively use the BayesiaLab software platform. Therefore, you have access to a full license of BayesiaLab Professional for a 30-day period starting on the first day of the course. This gives you the opportunity to replicate all examples from the course at your leisure on your own computer. \n \nDate and Location \nJuly 2-3, 2015 9:00am-5:00pm (both days) \nSingapore Management University School of Accountancy 60 Stamford Road Seminar Room 2.5 Singapore 178899 \nOverview \nDay 1 \n\nIntroductory Examples of Probabilistic Reasoning:\nProsecutor's Fallacy\nSimpson's Paradox\nBayes' Rule and the Bayesian Network Formalism\nGraph Structures, d-Separation\nEncoding Bayesian Networks from Domain Knowledge\nOmnidirectional Inference for Diagnosis and Simulation\nObservation versus Intervention/Causation\n\nDay 2 \n\nPrerequisites for Machine-Learning Bayesian Networks:\nInformation Theory, incl.
