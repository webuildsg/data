TOPIC 1: Using PowerShell with SQL Server Business Intelligence PowerShell is a command-line based scripting language used by IT Professionals to automate system administration tasks in Windows platforms. Either via built in cmdlets or an exposed API (SMO), SQL Server professionals can harness the power of PowerShell and leverage it to their organizations' advantage. In this presentation, you will learn some of the ways you can use PowerShell in SQL Server BI Administration in an enterprise environment. You will acquire practical knowledge to start utilizing PowerShell yourself. Finally, you will be inspired on how simple it is to automate those repetitive administration tasks. About Speaker:  Vanessa Rose Castro is a Regulatory Reports Engineer at ING Bank N.V., Singapore. On her daily job she uses Microsoft SQL Server to deliver Business Intelligence to ING branches across South East Asia. You can find solutions to BI development and administrative problems, as well as book reviews on her space on the internet: http://vaniecastro.com/. TOPIC 2: Transaction Log.The SQL Transaction log is one of the most misunderstood parts of SQL Server in terms of how it works. The presentation would cover the basic terminology, logs architectural and VLF algorithm, a few undocumented commands to scan the log file(s), 3-4 domes to relate things with real time with internal details explanation. Besides these, the presentation would also cover what would be the best way to implement log files considering the number of VLFs.

Clarence Tauro from CouchBase will be traveling to Singapore on that week and will be our guest speaker. We have interviewed Clarence here. Abstract NoSQL databases offer a significant change to how enterprise applications are built, challenging to two-decade hegemony of relational databases. The question people face is whether NoSQL databases are an appropriate choice, either for new projects or to introduce to existing projects. This talk will give a rapid introduction to NoSQL databases: where they came from, the nature of the data models they use, and the different way you have to think about consistency and polyglot persistence. It will then dive into Couchbase, which is a high-performance NoSQL distributed database with a flexible data model. Finally it will discuss how to integrate CouchBase with Spring using the Spring Data Couchbase project.  ============================================Note: if you are interested to go for CouchBase training in Singapore, all information is available here:  http://training.couchbase.com/class/for-developers/cd220-developing-couchbase-nosql-applications/singapore-central-singapore/2015a","location":"PayPal office in Suntec, 5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, 038985 Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/224470403/","group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"20 Aug 2015, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-20T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"1563358550577683","name":"ArtScience Late","description":"[TICKETS SOLD OUT!] \nRyoji Ikeda: Supercodex\nThursday 20 August, 8pm\nArtScience Museum, Level 4\n\nhttp://www.marinabaysands.com/museum/exhibitions-and-events/artscience-late.html  \n\nPREPARE TO BE IMMERSED IN A MULTI-SENSORIAL EXTRAVAGANZA.\n\nArtScience Museum is thrilled to welcome Japan’s leading electronic composer and visual artist, Ryoji Ikeda, to the museum for one night only.\n\nSonic artist, visual artist, and composer in one, Ryoji Ikeda has gained international renown for his striking audiovisual artworks. Ikeda's work is deeply rooted in an ongoing investigation of mathematics and science. He uses stunning, immersive visuals, and a distinctive electronic music style to communicate complex topics about the outer limits of science, in a highly accessible way.  \n\nHis performance for ArtScience Late, as part of the Sound Islands Festival, is supercodex [live set]. It makes the invisible data that permeates our world tangible and perceivable.  The performance showcases how sound can be turned into data and how data can be turned into sound.  supercodex [live set] draws inspirations from the idea of quantum superposition, a key principle of contemporary physics. It investigates how we understand the reality of nature on an atomic scale through mathematical models and quantum mechanics. supercodex [live set] begins subtly, with digital noise, pure tones and bass drones, and gradually builds into an immersive, textured sensory audiovisual experience.\n\nDon’t miss this unique opportunity to see one of the world's most acclaimed experimental performers, in an extraordinary live event that is bound to be an unforgettable experience. \n\nConcept, composition: Ryoji Ikeda\nComputer graphics, programming: Tomonaga Tokuyama\nFor more information please visit: http://www.ryojiikeda.com/archive/concerts/#supercodex_live_set\n\nPart of the Soundislands Festival [Logo] \n\nAbout Ryoji Ikeda\n\nHailing from Japan, and based in France, Ryoji Ikeda focuses on the essential characteristics of sound, light and mathematics. He has gained a reputation as one of the few international artists working convincingly across both visual and sonic media. He elaborately orchestrates sound, visuals, materials, physical phenomena and mathematical notions into immersive live performances and installations.\nHe has performed and exhibited worldwide in the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo, MoMA New York, Tate Modern in London, Ars Electronica Center Linz, Elektra Festival Montreal, Sonar Festival Barcelona, Aichi Triennale Nagoya, Palazzo Grassi Venice, Park Avenue Armory New York, Museo de Arte Bogota, Hamburger Bahnhof Berlin, Sharjah Biennale, Auckland Triennale, MONA Museum Hobart, Telefonica Foundation Madrid, and many other locations.\n\nHe has recently been touring his new performance, superposition, in major venues such as Centre Pompidou in Paris, Barbican Center in London, Kyoto Experiment in Japan, Concertgebouw Brugge and Amsterdam, Metropolitan Museum in New York, Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and Center for the Arts of Performance UCLA in Los Angeles.

Imagine the possibility to curate a virtual building of all the rooms, just like orchard road. Each room is a virtual shop in the building. Imagine the possibility to bring your possible customer to place or experience that you want them to experience to advertise your product. Such as taking your customer to taste a glimpse of Japan before showing them the Japan tour package. The $22tn retail industry is for us, the Virtual Reality Enthusiast to explore and set pace. Being able to simulate the real shopping experience whilst in the comfort of their own home is another big step from the present online shopping experiences.  And for marketers looking to VR / AR as a way of delivering richer brand experiences, we’ll look at examples from Nissan, Castrol, Marriott Hotels, Dior and Patron.
