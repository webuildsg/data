More than the terms, practices, meetings and user stories, the Agile Mindset keeps the team on point and helps them self-manage even if they aren’t too familiar with the terms used in Agile. But what is a Mindset? Why is this more important than the terms and practices of Agile on the habitual and personal level? Essentially a mindset is a culture that you implement with the incentive to accept or adopt the cultural norms. If you want to truly implement Agile, it has to become a part of your company’s culture.
