It doesn’t really matter if you are a beginner or an advanced user of Adobe Illustrator, the hottest topic would be about why Adobe Illustrator takes so long to load and save a file. In this session, Mark Plunkett - Director and Designer of Dexel, a graphic design agency will share about some of his most used tips and features during projects at his workplace. ===================== Creative design tools for Mobile App Developers By Arul Kumaran Hear from Arul Kumaran, CTO and Multiplatform Developer at Luracast Singapore to share his experience on the design and development of mobile applications. Developers will also need to know design tools well in order to better market their apps. In this session, you will explore some of the techniques using image editing tool, Adobe Photoshop and screen design tool, Adobe Fireworks on developing mobile apps. He will also share some of the plugins that can make them even more powerful and helpful for the given tasks. ===================== Allow your designs to shine By Linus Lim One of the design principles is to create order and hierarchy in your designs resulting in beautiful and easy to read layouts. In this session you will learn the tips to apply alignments into your designs to give them a professional edge. Icons are used everywhere in user interfaces for websites and mobile apps. The design principle for designing icons is to keep them simple, modern and friendly. Linus will also share how he draws icons for your screen design.","location":"Toa Payoh Public Library","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/324763197721363","group_name":"Creative Crew Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/14431580201","formatted_time":"13 Jan 2015, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-01-13T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-13T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"218852617","name":"Introduction to JSON-Autotype","description":" It would be a good way to celebrate a new year with a Haskell Talk. In January, Michał J Gajda, the author of hPDB ( http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hPDB ) is going to share his exciting new work: json-autotype to help Haskeller write Web Application API. Here is his description for the content of the talk. ====== There are huge APIs written entirely in JSON, and thus untyped, and unsafe to call. The traditional way to deal with this problem in strongly typed languages like Haskell, is not to examine untyped `Value` type provided by the parser, but rather write conversion functions for intended API types, and thus ensure type checking on a boundary between Web application and Haskell code. I propose to use an automatic tool json-autotype, to generate datatype declarations with Aeson's FromJSON instances from a set of example .json files. That greatly speeds up the process, and allows for very quick and well checked interfacing relatively large APIs. I will also explain the theory behind this tool.

In 1994, Professor Schmidt and Professor Nicholas Suntzeff formed the HighZ SN search team, a group of 20 astronomers on five continents who used distant exploding stars to trace the expansion of the Universe back in time. The group’s discovery of an accelerating Universe was a startling one suggesting that an unknown force is countering the effect of gravity and pushing the Universe apart.  \nProfessor Schmidt continues his work using exploding stars to study the Universe, and is leading Australian National University’s Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics’ effort to build the SkyMapper telescope. \nAs part of the International Peace Foundation’s “Bridges – Dialogues Towards a Culture of Peace” speaker series at NUS, Professor Schmidt will also undertake engagements with Yale-NUS College. \n  \n\n  \n“Science: Humanity’s Universal Bridge”  \nScience is one of the few arenas where humanity has worked together through history for our collective good. In his speech, Professor Schmidt will discuss the role of science through the ages in shaping our current society, reflecting on the good and the bad its knowledge has brought. While science's impact in our daily lives is higher now than ever before, to cope with future challenges the world will need further improve how it works together.

Migrating packages.config to project.json for server packages, using bower instead of nuget to fetch client libraries, using grunt instead of build script to compile typescript and less and to run JavaScript unit test, setting up MVC, Web API and SignalR and using Kestrel to run the application on a Linux VM. - by Nyuyen Quy Hy • Dependency Injection with .NET MVC/WebAPI . Dependency injection is a powerful and fundamental software design pattern to building loosely coupled, highly unit testable software. Explore the 3 main ways of dependency injection (Constructor, Setter, Interface) and look at a simple and practical approach towards implementing IoC for any .NET MVC/WEB API project. - by Donovan Huang • Creating your own website using ASP.NET MVC 5 + AngularJS from 0 to go live . You can just learn or you can follow to create the website and add public domain name. I buy the domain from Namecheap.com , quite cheap only $3.98 per year. The presentation is fully step-by-step walk through, so by the end of the presentation, your own website will go live. You can update your own website easily from Visual Studio.

Come to a space where interaction, collaboration and experimentation are de rigueur of the night, and chill out with music and our bar overlooking Marina Bay. Hypermnesia 8pm & 9pm featuring Composit formed by Shunsuke Francois Nanjo (Japan/France), Kensuke Christophe Nanjo (Japan/France) and Nicolas Charbonnier (France) in collaboration with Eisa Jocson (The Philippines) The installation Hypermnesia is the result of artists and mechanical engineers working together. The team have developed for this unique occasion an interactive pole installation for the internationally celebrated choreographer/performer Eisa Jocson. The artwork will react to her body heat and movement, and the audience is also invited to interact with the artwork through touch, altering the sound in the background.

CALLING ALL DEVELOPERS .... JOIN THE BIG DATA FOR SOCIAL GOOD CHALLENGE Big data exists in just about everything we use and do. It comes from phones, cars, roads, power lines, waterways, food crates, and innumerable other items you’d never think of as computers. This data speaks volumes about our collective behavior and society – so let’s use it to do something incredible! IBM invites developers and data enthusiasts to take a deep dive into real world civic issues using big data and the IBM Bluemix Analytics for Hadoop service . Analyze one of our curated datasets or bring your own (provided it meets these requirements)! Use Hadoop and your data to create a clickable and interactive data visualization to highlight insights that you’ve found. Ready to get started? $40,000 in prizes will be awarded.... Register here: http://ibmhadoop.challengepost.com/ What to Create: Participants must create a working, clickable, and interactive data visualization utilizing the Analytics for Hadoop service on IBM Bluemix. Data Requirements: Your data visualization must analyze one or more datasets included in the curated list of datasets on the Data page OR meet the data size, content, and licensing requirements described on the Data page . The total size of the Datasets analyzed must be between 500MB - 7GB in size. Check out the requirements then go get your IBM Bluemix extended promo code and check out the datasets !
