A distinct object such as a pin or hat established their dominance in a field. \n“Coders”, as we define them here, have become the world’s newest artisans. Just as master builders were essential for the creation of a business 400 years ago, Coders are needed for everything from website creation to server maintenance and developing new in-house platforms. \nYet there is no identifying seal showcasing the quality of Coders, their rank amongst peers or even their trials and accomplishments. \nEnter the MasterCard Masters of Code Competition. Through this intense series of hackathons we have one goal: to traverse the globe and engage the very best Coders. \nEach regional hackathon will have developers, designers and entrepreneurs using the MasterCard APIs to create masterful prototypes that demonstrate artful coding and design skills, while articulating clear business cases. \nThe competition will be intense and the tension high, but we are looking to create a different experience for our participants. Each event will be held in one of the most thriving tech communities worldwide – and at the best venues there. Winners from each region will be flown out for the Grand Finale Masters of Code Hackathon in Silicon Valley to experience a MasterCard Priceless Experience – Northern California. The final itself will be just like the regionals with up to ten teams from the region events and one MasterCard elite team of Coders. \nThe winning team will be recognized as the first Masters of Code Champions and given their Masters of Code Jackets, $100,000 and many other perks. \nOnly the global winning team will be given this honor and privilege. \n  \n \nRegional Level: \nEach region has a specific Challenge, Featured API and Secret API that attendees can go after.  While you don't have to use all three in your hack, bonus points will be awarded to those that do. \n  \nThe Singapore Challenge: \nUsing Commerce/Payments to Empower Women \nThe Singapore Featured API: \n Simplify Commerce \nThe Singapore Secret API: \nShh, you'll have to wait for the event to find that out... \n \n \nGrand Prize* \nThe MasterCard Masters of Code Champions will be crowned and will receive $100,000 to develop their innovation, in addition to the following prizes*: \n\nTwo weeks on-site at the MasterCard Start Path™ accelerator location in Dublin, Ireland, or an alternate remote program\nSix months of mentoring from a member of the MasterCard Open API executive team and the Start Path program team\nFree payment processing for up to $250,000 in transactions for the first 12 months using Simplify Commerce**..\n\n*Prizes may be modified to accommodate regional availability and regulations of the winning team location **Legal Disclaimer: To qualify for this promotion, a Masters of Code team must apply to become and be approved as a Simplify Commerce merchant and actively transact via Simplify Commerce Gateway. “Actively transact means conducting a sales transaction that results in Simplify Commerce making a deposit to the checking account you have linked to your Simplify Commerce merchant account. If you qualify, Simplify Commerce will rebate the 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction processing fee for your first $250,000 in sales that occurs within 12 months after the company becomes a Simplify Commerce merchant. Should a transaction be refunded, it will not be eligible for a rebate. After the company reaches $250,000 in sales, processing fees will remain 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction (or the standard rate at that time). \n  \n\nRegional Winner \n\nSingapore Masters of Code Title: The first of it's kind.\nPlace in the Grand Finale in Silicon Valley in December:  The winning team will be flown to Silicon Valley to compete in the Grand Finale Masters of Code hackathon (up to 5 members)\nMasterCard Priceless® Experience in Napa Valley and San Francisco – while at the Grand Finale in December\n\n  \nRegional Runner-Up \nEach regional runner-up team member will receive a $500 USD MasterCard gift card. \n\n \n \nRules: \n\nTeams of up to 5 humans are allowed.
