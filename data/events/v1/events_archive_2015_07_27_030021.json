More than the terms, practices, meetings and user stories, the Agile Mindset keeps the team on point and helps them self-manage even if they aren’t too familiar with the terms used in Agile. But what is a Mindset? Why is this more important than the terms and practices of Agile on the habitual and personal level? Essentially a mindset is a culture that you implement with the incentive to accept or adopt the cultural norms. If you want to truly implement Agile, it has to become a part of your company’s culture.

Sonic artist, visual artist, electronic composer and computer-musician in one, Ryoji Ikeda has gained international renown for his provocative work combining visuals and sound. ArtScience Museum is delighted to host the performance of Ikeda’s supercodex [live set], which reworks musical concepts from Ikeda’s 2013 superposition piece, which investigates how we understand the reality of nature on an atomic scale, taking its starting point in mathematical models and quantum mechanics. supercodex [live set] begins subtly, with digital noise, blips and bass drones, from which gradually emerges the core elements of techno and dance music, where Ikeda uses raw data and mathematical models to generate music and projections. Don’t miss this extraordinary live performance, where the accompanying visuals add to the rich textures to merge the senses, creating an unforgettable experience.
