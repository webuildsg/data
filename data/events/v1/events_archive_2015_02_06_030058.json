In 2012, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to research on genetically induced adult stem cells for “advancing therapy”. This has led to the unprecedented growth in the arena of regenerative medicine using patients’ own cells. As we see a dwindling number of approved small molecule drugs and rising promises of biologics, can we ride on the wave of cell therapy as the next blockbuster or personalised therapeutics? Biotech Connection Singapore brings you a panel of key opinion figures in the Singapore cell therapy community, as we discuss the opportunities and challenges of translating stem cell research into clinical applications.    \n-          Are our technologies ready to develop the ideal candidate for cell-based therapy possessing characteristics such as accessibility, ease of scaling up, long tern safety profile and autologous in nature, etc? \n-          In terms of business models, is Singapore going to stagnate at the level of cord blood banking instead of leading the frontier of cell therapy?  \n-          Japan, Korea and China have emerged as the strong contenders in the development of cell therapy. Is our regulatory framework sufficiently established to administer cell therapy trials locally?  \n-          How do we prevent non-compliant clinical practices which put desperate patients at risks? \n  \nProgramme \n6:30 – 7:00 PM               Registration \n 7:00 – 7:10 PM               BCS & Speaker Introduction   \n7:10 – 8:30 PM               Panel Discussion and Q&A   \n8:30 – 9:30 PM               Networking Reception \n  \nOur Speakers \n  \nProf. James Hui  \nHead & Senior Consultant, Division of Paediatric Orthopaedics \nDirector, Cartilage Repair Program, National University Health System, Singapore \n  \n  \n  \nProf. James Hui specializes in the management of orthopaedic problems in children, as well as general orthopaedics.
