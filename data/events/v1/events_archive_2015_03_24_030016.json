Researchers from RIT (Rakuten Institute of Technology), including head of RIT Global will speak on their research work. Update: Strictly by registration, no walk-ins. Attendees will need to present a valid IC to the building security in order to receive an access pass. To check if you have successfully registered for the meetup, please refer here . Agenda: Event starts at 7.15 pm. - Welcome by Ewa Szymanksa, heading RIT Singapore - RIT global overview by Masaya Mori, the founder of RIT - Case study by Youngjoo: Information retrieval – Finding food entity relationships using user-generated data in a Recipe Sharing Service Abstract: Rakuten recipe is a Japanese recipe site where users submit and share their recipes with other users. Since the contents are user-generated, the recipes often contain misspellings, abbreviations, synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms. Identifying and normalizing these words is essential to retrieving relevant recipes according to user's search request. In this talk, Youngjoo will introduce a new approach to finding related words in a recipe domain using the data structure. Speakers’ bios: Youngjoo Chung is a lead scientist in RIT Tokyo. She joined RIT after receiving her Ph.D in Information science and Technology from University of Tokyo in 2011. Her research interests include information retrieval, data mining, outlier detection, and recommender systems. Masaya Mori is the founder of Rakuten Institute of Technology, and is responsible for developing and managing R&D activities and IT strategies within the Rakuten Group. Before joining Rakuten, Mori-san spent eight years at Accenture, where he played a lead role in IT visioning and strategy planning, while consulting for major companies in the products and public services industries in Japan.

Pytest is a great alternative testing framework to unittest from the standard library. It often lets you get the same tests written with far fewer lines of code, and it has a cool dependency injection system to help you share common test dependencies while keeping your tests understandable. I'll tell you all about how to get basic unit testing done, and I'll show you how to use Voidspace's Mock library to test collaborations between your objects, too. Gabe is a full-stack senior engineer at Neo Innovation, with a thirst for knowledge and a passion for sharing what he's learned. He's had the pleasure of speaking on four different continents about JavaScript, Ruby, Vim, and HTML5 Game development. 2. \"Developing real time applications in Django with Websockets \" by Gerald Goh Utilising swampdragon , I'll be showing how to build a simple real time chat application in Django. Gerald is a full stack developer at Apvera Pte.

MasterCard hackathon is taking place in Singapore on March 28-29. Use the code HackAngel for free tickets. http://bit.ly/mocsg The CONCEPT How is a truly gifted Coder (as in programmers, designers and developers) distinguished today? For thousands of years, master artisans were honored with an insignia in recognition of their talent. A distinct object such as a pin or hat established their dominance in a field. “Coders”, as we define them here, have become the world’s newest artisans. Just as master builders were essential for the creation of a business 400 years ago, Coders are needed for everything from website creation to server maintenance and developing new in-house platforms. Yet there is no identifying seal showcasing the quality of Coders, their rank amongst peers or even their trials and accomplishments. Enter the MasterCard Masters of Code Competition. Through this intense series of hackathons we have one goal: to traverse the globe and engage the very best Coders. Each regional hackathon will have developers, designers and entrepreneurs using the MasterCard APIs to create masterful prototypes that demonstrate artful coding and design skills, while articulating clear business cases. The competition will be intense and the tension high, but we are looking to create a different experience for our participants. Each event will be held in one of the most thriving tech communities worldwide – and at the best venues there. Winners from each region will be flown out for the Grand Finale Masters of Code Hackathon in Silicon Valley to experience a MasterCard Priceless Experience – Northern California. The final itself will be just like the regionals with up to ten teams from the region events and one MasterCard elite team of Coders. The winning team will be recognized as the first Masters of Code Champions and given their Masters of Code Jackets, $100,000 and many other perks. Only the global winning team will be given this honor and privilege. THE COMPETITION Regional Level: Each region has a specific Challenge, Featured API and Secret API that attendees can go after. While you don't have to use all three in your hack, bonus points will be awarded to those that do. The Singapore Challenge: Using Commerce/Payments to Empower Women The Singapore Featured API: Simplify Commerce The Singapore Secret API: Shh, you'll have to wait for the event to find that out... PRIZES Grand Prize* The MasterCard Masters of Code Champions will be crowned and will receive $100,000 to develop their innovation, in addition to the following prizes*: Two weeks on-site at the MasterCard Start Path™ accelerator location in Dublin, Ireland, or an alternate remote program Six months of mentoring from a member of the MasterCard Open API executive team and the Start Path program team Free payment processing for up to $250,000 in transactions for the first 12 months using Simplify Commerce**.. *Prizes may be modified to accommodate regional availability and regulations of the winning team location **Legal Disclaimer: To qualify for this promotion, a Masters of Code team must apply to become and be approved as a Simplify Commerce merchant and actively transact via Simplify Commerce Gateway. “Actively transact means conducting a sales transaction that results in Simplify Commerce making a deposit to the checking account you have linked to your Simplify Commerce merchant account. If you qualify, Simplify Commerce will rebate the 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction processing fee for your first $250,000 in sales that occurs within 12 months after the company becomes a Simplify Commerce merchant. Should a transaction be refunded, it will not be eligible for a rebate. After the company reaches $250,000 in sales, processing fees will remain 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction (or the standard rate at that time). Regional Winner Singapore Masters of Code Title: The first of it's kind. Place in the Grand Finale in Silicon Valley in December: The winning team will be flown to Silicon Valley to compete in the Grand Finale Masters of Code hackathon (up to 5 members) MasterCard Priceless® Experience in Napa Valley and San Francisco – while at the Grand Finale in December Regional Runner-Up Each regional runner-up team member will receive a $500 USD MasterCard gift card. RULES AND JUDGING CRITERIA Rules: Teams of up to 5 humans are allowed. You can also add 1 cyborg, Furby, drone, or Sphero. All team members must have completed the participation agreement to compete. We all start coding at the same time. This is done to keep things fair. Please don't come in and build on top of previous projects if you want to win. You must demo your hack in order to present. No slide-decks or power-points will be allowed. 2 minute presentation 1 minute Q&A from Judges. Teams have full ownership of everything they build at our events and are free to do with it as they wish. Each hackathon has its individual hackathon.io page, which projects should be submitted on. Submission time is 1pm Sunday. Winning teams will be subject to a code-review at some point following the event or immediately before winning.

You are probably in the right place. Registration RSVP yes if you can commit that whole afternoon to code and answered yes on the 4 prerequisites below. Four Prerequisites 1. Read the book Working Effectively with Legacy Code or otherwise, read a short article about it. 2. Already understood why writing automated unit tests and Test-Driven Development is beneficial. 3. Have experience working in Java, C# or other similar Object-Oriented programming language 4. Able to attend from 1:00pm to 5:00pm *** Do not need to rsvp if you are just coming to observe during that time. *** Background Have you experienced codes that are hard to understand and is brittle? How do you deal with that more effectively? We're going to spend four solid afternoon hours to practice how to work more effectively with legacy code by having coding dojo with the Trivia Game.
