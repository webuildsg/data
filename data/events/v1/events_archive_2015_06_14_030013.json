This talk will briefly look into a secure development lifecycle before explaining fuzzing and the different techniques that can be applied. The talk concludes with some findings and statistics that have been collected over the time. • Breaking BYOD on Apple iOS by Vincent The global market for BYOD and enterprise mobility is expected to almost quadruple in size over the next four years, hitting $284 billion by 2019. BYOD software is used by some of the largest organizations and governments around the work. Barclays, AT&T, Vodafone, US DHS, US Army, Australian Department of Energy. BYOD software promises security for enterprises. It solves Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Network privacy, jailbreaking devices, but does it really? Nope, it doesn’t! For the past 4 months, I’ve been researching into these advanced functionality that applications are using. The result of my research is an approach to defeating BYOD and advanced iOS security mechanisms in an easy and effective manner. This talk will demonstrate not only how I’ve done it but will also include a tool / framework which was designed for that purpose. Speaker(s) Bio: Michael is a security consultant at SEC Consult. His main interest is towards the offensive realm of information security, particularly vulnerability research and exploit development. Vincent is working as senior security consultant at Vantage Point Security. He is a sharp, cold-blooded, highly focused hacker with a passion for advanced mobile exploitation executed with kiasu perfection. Singaporean by birth, Vincent defies the local stereotype of accepting ‘cannot’ for an answer and lives in a world of only pure possibility. Randen: is a software engineer having 12 years of experience in working on both Enterprise/Proprietary and Open Source Technologies. Currently he is more involve in developing API and mobile applications. He had been interested with security and applies it to how he is developing his applications.

The weirdness of light","description":"  \n   \nMaxwell's wave or Einstein's LichtQuanten? The weirdness of light  \nSince the early days of quantum mechanics, interference between spatially separated trajectories of a single particle has not ceased to fascinate physicists. I will present experiments realized with a single photon, which have allowed us to emphasize the weirdness of the concept of wave particle duality, at the root of the quantum revolution of the 20th century. Such single photon sources are now an important resource in the domain of quantum information and quantum cryptography. \n  \n \nBorn in 1947, Alain Aspect is an alumni of ENS Cachan and Université d'Orsay. After three years teaching in Cameroon, he became a lecturer at ENS Cachan, with his research at Institut d'Optique. In 1985 he took a research position at ENS/Collège de France, with Claude Cohen-Tannoudji. Since 1992 he has been a CNRS senior researcher (emeritus since 2012), at Institut d'Optique. He is also a professor at Institut d'Optique Graduat School (Augustin Fresnel chair), and at Ecole Polytechnique, in Palaiseau. He is a member of the Académie des Sciences (France), Académie des Technologies (France), National Academy of Sciences (USA), OAW (Austria). \nAlain Aspect first research bore upon tests of Bell's inequalities with entangled photon pairs (PhD 1983), then wave-particle duality for single photons. With Claude Cohen-Tannoudji he developed new methods for cooling atoms with lasers. Since 1992, he is in the Atom Optics group that he has established at Institut d'Optique, where research bears upon quantum atom optics, quantum degenerate gases and atom lasers, quantum simulators of disordered materials. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nThis event is organised by the Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore in partnership with the Science Centre Singapore.

If the spending on maintenance work is more than 30-40%, it could indicate significant areas for improvement within the IT Department. Vasant will also share his experience on how IT spending can be tracked, measured and embedded within the IT processes so as to help provide indicators to the effectiveness of IT in an organisation.
