Here's the line-up for the Meetup: * Customising Your Own Web Framework in Go Jonathan Gomez, Engineer @ Zumata At Zumata we use Go in our main API. We've chosen a mix of using the Go standard library and bite-sized open-source components (i.e. handling routing/middleware/persistence), rather than adopting a fuller web framework, or relying purely on the standard lib. This talk outlines our experiences, and aims to help you get started building and structuring your APIs in Go. * Adventures in IoT with Golang Lakshan Perera & Audrey Lim Sharing our little experiments in trying to power anything and everything with Go. * Pop Quiz (10-20 mins) We are introducing a new segment from this year, so come prepared to write code (bring your laptop or a pen & paper) As usual, there will be pizza.","location":"Nitrous IO, 1 Trengganu St, 2nd Floor, Singapore 058455, Singapore","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1597830553769337","group_name":"Singapore Gophers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/1406742666273764","formatted_time":"20 Jan 2015, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-01-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-16T18:40:20.530Z"},{"id":"219604344","name":"Hello, World! in Drupal 8 and Open Space","description":" This month's presentation is an introduction to developing in Drupal 8 where Joe Chin will go through the steps of creating a simple \"Hello, World!\" module and theming it up.

In 1994, Professor Schmidt and Professor Nicholas Suntzeff formed the HighZ SN search team, a group of 20 astronomers on five continents who used distant exploding stars to trace the expansion of the Universe back in time. The group’s discovery of an accelerating Universe was a startling one suggesting that an unknown force is countering the effect of gravity and pushing the Universe apart.  \nProfessor Schmidt continues his work using exploding stars to study the Universe, and is leading Australian National University’s Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics’ effort to build the SkyMapper telescope. \nJointly hosted by NUS and Yale-NUS College, this public lecture is part of the International Peace Foundation’s “Bridges – Dialogues Towards a Culture of Peace” speaker series at NUS. \n\n  \n“Science: Humanity’s Universal Bridge”  \nScience is one of the few arenas where humanity has worked together through history for our collective good. In his speech, Professor Schmidt will discuss the role of science through the ages in shaping our current society, reflecting on the good and the bad its knowledge has brought. While science's impact in our daily lives is higher now than ever before, to cope with future challenges the world will need further improve how it works together. It is through continual advances in our knowledge that we can hope to have the billions of the world's inhabitants live in peace and prosperity into the future.","location":"Shaw Foundation Alumni House Auditorium, Level 2, 11 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore 119244","url":"http://nusbridges.eventbrite.sg/?aff=ebapi","group_name":"National University of Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/7684522735/","formatted_time":"21 Jan 2015, Wed, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-01-21T11:30:00Z","end_time":"2015-01-21T13:30:00Z"},{"id":"219634734","name":"Introducing Application Security in Your Organization - Think Like a Developer","description":" In this session, the speaker, Sandeep Nain, from HP Australia and a former co-lead from OWASP Melbourne Chapter, will cover the following topics: 1.
