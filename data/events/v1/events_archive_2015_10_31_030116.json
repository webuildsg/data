We have come out with this special event with PayPal and invited Douglas to give a talk to the SingaporeJS community! Upgrading the Web  The web was originally imagined to be a simple distributed document retrieval system. It is now being used for applications that go far beyond the system's original capabilities and intentions. We have found ways to make it work, but they are difficult and far too fragile. Many times companies have offered to replace the web with superior proprietary systems, but we rejected them. We have been adding features to the web, but this does little to correct the deep underlying deficiencies, increasing instead of reducing its complexity. This talk suggests a way forward, taking inspiration from our successful transition from NTSC to HDTV. There is a way forward to a web that is safer, easier, and as good as we desire. Douglas Crockford is best known for his ongoing involvement in the development of the JavaScript language, for having popularized JSON, and for developing various JavaScript tools such as JSLint and JSMin. He is currently a senior JavaScript architect at PayPal, and is also a writer and speaker on JavaScript, JSON, and related web technologies.

These principles help reduce the cost, time and risk of delivering changes, and ultimately value, to customers by allowing for more incremental changes to applications in production. Continuous integration (CI) is the practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. In the same vein, the practice of continuous delivery further extends CI by making sure the software checked in on the mainline is always in a state that can be deployed to users and makes the actual deployment process very rapid. So, in this rapid and fast world of CI-CD, focusing on highly scalable &amp; highly portable software landscape, which offers high usage oriented web apps, the security landscape has really reached to cutting edge point. This talk, will focus on how to posturize security with this fast pace world, covering most of all security verticals.
