Julia is fast becoming the de facto language of technical computing and is finding new applications every day such as in databases and embedded systems. This workshop will introduce the language and also present use cases for technical computing, statistics, big data applications, high performance, and in education. The workshop, aimed at professionals, researchers, and students, will illustrate how Julia's ease-of-use and fast execution go hand in hand. Upon completion of this workshop, attendees will understand what Julia has to offer over other open source systems such as Python, R, and even commercial systems as well. Julia’s dynamic system allows for scalable fault-tolerant cloud based systems. Examples of Julia running in the cloud will be provided. We will explain Julia’s design including multiple dispatch and the sophisticated type system, and why engineers, scientists, and statisticians can benefit from these concepts. Julia offers a solution to the \"two-language problem\" whereby one wastefully prototypes in one (slower) language and then deploys in another (faster) language. \nThe second part of the tutorial will cover OpenTuner, a open source framework for building domain-specific multi-objective program autotuners, a simple way for improving the performance and efficiency of high performance applications. High performance applications have many tunable parameters. Finding the right values for these parameters for a given architecture is a challenge for many programmers. OpenTuner is a machine learning based framework that provides a simple workflow to find good configurations for even very complex parameter spaces. OpenTuner has been used by a number of different projects to build domain specific autotuners. We will also demonstrate available autotuners for the JVM and gcc that can give an immediate and significant performance boost for existing applications. \n\n\n\n\n  \nAlan Edelman\nMIT Mathematics and CSAIL\nProfessor\n\n\n  \nJiahao Chen\nMIT CSAIL\nResearch Scientist\n\n\n  \nSaman P Amarasinghe\nMIT EECS and CSAIL\nProfessor\n\n\n\n","location":"Stephen Riady Centre LT50 (Level 1), , University Town, 2 College Avenue West, Singapore 138607, Singapore null","url":"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/tutorial-on-high-performance-cloud-computing-technologies-julia-opentuner-tickets-4866645267?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Alan Edelman, Saman P.
