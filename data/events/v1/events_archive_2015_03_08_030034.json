The process is simple and fast and gives you the flexibility to make 1 single board or multiple different prototype boards for testing. This workshop will introduce participants to the process of making PCB boards using a laser printer, transfer media paper and a heat press machine. Participants will get to make and assemble a working PCB board containing a 7805 regulator circuit that will take in 7-12V and output 5V. All materials are provided.

However, I regularly come across users who aren't aware that there are many ways to copy beyond the standard copy and paste command. Join me in this session and be amazed at the many more powerful ways that InDesign can help you duplicate stuff. Session 2 Ever wondered about editorial layouts and how we can fit copy into allocated text boxes or what are copy editing terms such as Rags, Widows and Orphans. Good typography requires a good sense of understanding about creating a copy layout with simple and easy to read columns. Some may be easily solved with InDesign, while others requires manual editing.

No problem! This is a half day event for complete beginners. Using recorded content from the Microsoft Virtual Academy and demonstrations from a PowerShell MVP and the User Group Leads, you'll finish the day much more confident with PowerShell than you were before. We have been hearing from the Community that there are not enough sessions for Beginners, also, some people are not confident about using PowerShell because they haven't had a good enough grounding in the fundamentals. We would like to address that. Using some amazing content on the Microsoft Virtual Academy by PowerShells creator Jeffrey Snover and PowerShell MVP Jason Helmick,we will cover some basics of PowerShell; using the shell, understanding Objects, mastering the Help system and understanding the Pipeline. These are core skills that once mastered will help you advance faster along your PowerShell journey. This session will be delivered using Videos from the MVA, group discussions, demos by the group leads and hands on. It is important to bring your own laptop, as the intended outcome of this is to build confidence through your own hands-on experience. You can find the MVA content that we will follow at http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/getting-started-with-powershell-3-0-jump-start . It is recommended that you watch Video 01 before the day as preparation. We will cover videos 2 to 5 together on the day and any more if time allows. Following this session you can finish the MVA course on your own time or join us for another session in March to finish, if you prefer the group interaction. Please remember this is for Complete Beginners and all content will be at that level, though Intermediate folks may learn some tips and tricks along the way also. See you there!

The consistent strategic problem faced by law enforcement agencies globally is how to achieve the best results with limited resources.  This includes maintaining public order, reducing crime, or maintaining the current status quo with reduced resources. In order to solve these issues, we must discover the actionable predictors (such as time and weather) of different types of crime, specific to each location or place type (such as a neighborhood or nightclub), in order that resources are used to best effect. This talk examines preliminary results using the UK Police Crimes and Outcomes dataset from December 2010 to June 2014, which has a relatively large volume: more than 19 million crime and anti-social behavior incidents from 43 police forces ( please see http://data.police.uk/ ).\n\n\n\n  \n FAQs \nWhere can I contact the organiser with any questions? \nPlease feel free to email ryanlbk@tp.edu.sg if you have any questions.","location":"Temasek Polytechnic Auditorium 2 & Foyer, , 21 Tampines Avenue 1, Singapore 529757","url":"http://www.eventbrite.sg/e/tp-infotechday-2015-all-about-big-data-smart-solutions-iot-seminar-registration-16012532917?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Temasek Polytechnic School of Informatics & IT and Singapore Computer Society","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/7989857219/","formatted_time":"25 Mar 2015, Wed, 1:30 pm","start_time":"2015-03-25T05:30:00Z","end_time":"2015-03-25T10:30:00Z"},{"id":"15886244184","name":"Silicon chips with quantum inside?","description":"Silicon Chips with Quantum Insides? \nFor over half a century, silicon has been the material platform for the information processing revolution that has transformed our society. From Silicon Valley to Silicon Straits, this humble material has become synonymous with high-tech enterprise driven by the ever increasing computation power and shrinking size of CMOS processors. However, transistors cannot simply keep getting smaller (the characteristic size of CMOS transistors is now only 60 atoms wide). At these scales, the bizarre laws of quantum mechanics come into play: electrons can be in two places at once (called ‘superposition), and can ‘tunnel’ through barriers. Controlling electrons at these scales becomes a bit like herding (Schrödinger) cats, making it impossible to build basic computing components. Chip designers today have been using all their ingenuity to fend off this ‘quantum limit’ for a few more years with novel designs, but reaching the limit is inevitable. Instead of trying to work around these troublesome quantum effects, it is possible to build an entirely new type of computer whose operation fundamentally relies on quantum features such as superposition. There are a wide range of different technologies being explored to build such a ‘quantum computer’, including arrays of trapped ions addressed by lasers, and circuits of superconducting aluminium kept a few thousands of a degree above absolute zero. Recent results from laboratories around the world suggest that silicon could in fact provide a platform for such quantum processors - this include superposition states that last for 3 hours, or being able to measure individual dopant atoms in silicon nano-devices. We still have a little way to go before silicon can be considered to be on an equal footing with other quantum computing designs, but this isn’t the first time silicon has played catch-up. After all, lead sulfide and germanium were used to make transistors before high-purity silicon and CMOS technology came along. So far, we have every reason to think that silicon will survive the next big computational leap, from the classical to the quantum age. \n  \nJohn Morton studies the coherent control of electron and nuclear spins in solid state materials and devices, with a focus on quantum technologies. Quantum technologies are ones which exploit quantum superposition and entanglement to achieve major advances over current technologies in areas including communication, sensing and information processing. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nThis event is organised by the Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore in partnership with the Science Centre Singapore.","location":"Science Centre Singapore, , 15 Science Centre Rd, Singapore 609081","url":"http://cqt.eventbrite.sg/?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/2560122282/","formatted_time":"25 Mar 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-03-25T11:00:00Z","end_time":"2015-03-25T12:30:00Z"},{"id":"1559021821042963","name":"ArtScience Late","description":" One Thursday a month, 7pm to 10pm 2015:time:space: By Robert Casteels 8pm and 9pm Expression Gallery, Level 4 2015:time:space: is a collaborative work of voices, electronic instruments, live processing, tape and video.
