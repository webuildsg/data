In January, Michał J Gajda, the author of hPDB ( http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hPDB ) is going to share his exciting new work: json-autotype to help Haskeller write Web Application API. Here is his description for the content of the talk. ====== There are huge APIs written entirely in JSON, and thus untyped, and unsafe to call. The traditional way to deal with this problem in strongly typed languages like Haskell, is not to examine untyped `Value` type provided by the parser, but rather write conversion functions for intended API types, and thus ensure type checking on a boundary between Web application and Haskell code. I propose to use an automatic tool json-autotype, to generate datatype declarations with Aeson's FromJSON instances from a set of example .json files. That greatly speeds up the process, and allows for very quick and well checked interfacing relatively large APIs. I will also explain the theory behind this tool.

In 1994, Professor Schmidt and Professor Nicholas Suntzeff formed the HighZ SN search team, a group of 20 astronomers on five continents who used distant exploding stars to trace the expansion of the Universe back in time. The group’s discovery of an accelerating Universe was a startling one suggesting that an unknown force is countering the effect of gravity and pushing the Universe apart.  \nProfessor Schmidt continues his work using exploding stars to study the Universe, and is leading Australian National University’s Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics’ effort to build the SkyMapper telescope. \nAs part of the International Peace Foundation’s “Bridges – Dialogues Towards a Culture of Peace” speaker series at NUS, Professor Schmidt will also undertake engagements with Yale-NUS College. \n  \n\n  \n“Science: Humanity’s Universal Bridge”  \nScience is one of the few arenas where humanity has worked together through history for our collective good. In his speech, Professor Schmidt will discuss the role of science through the ages in shaping our current society, reflecting on the good and the bad its knowledge has brought. While science's impact in our daily lives is higher now than ever before, to cope with future challenges the world will need further improve how it works together. It is through continual advances in our knowledge that we can hope to have the billions of the world's inhabitants live in peace and prosperity into the future.","location":"Shaw Foundation Alumni House Auditorium, Level 2, 11 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore 119244","url":"http://nusbridges.eventbrite.sg/?aff=ebapi","group_name":"National University of Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/7684522735/","formatted_time":"21 Jan 2015, Wed, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-01-21T11:30:00Z","end_time":"2015-01-21T13:30:00Z"},{"id":"15003012414","name":"\"Future Cities: Prospects and Projections\"@Urban Lab","description":"Join us for the launch of Urban Lab, a new dedicated exhibition space by URA that profiles the most innovative solutions for a sustainable and liveable urban environment.

Try .NET... • Setting up ASP.NET MVC . See how you prepare setting up ASP.NET MVC. Migrating packages.config to project.json for server packages, using bower instead of nuget to fetch client libraries, using grunt instead of build script to compile typescript and less and to run JavaScript unit test, setting up MVC, Web API and SignalR and using Kestrel to run the application on a Linux VM. - by Nyuyen Quy Hy • Dependency Injection with .NET MVC/WebAPI . Dependency injection is a powerful and fundamental software design pattern to building loosely coupled, highly unit testable software. Explore the 3 main ways of dependency injection (Constructor, Setter, Interface) and look at a simple and practical approach towards implementing IoC for any .NET MVC/WEB API project. - by Donovan Huang • Creating your own website using ASP.NET MVC 5 + AngularJS from 0 to go live . You can just learn or you can follow to create the website and add public domain name. I buy the domain from Namecheap.com , quite cheap only $3.98 per year. The presentation is fully step-by-step walk through, so by the end of the presentation, your own website will go live. You can update your own website easily from Visual Studio. I'm going to use angulargo template to create the website or someones template if more interesting. You need to bring your laptop if you want to follow me step-by-step. - by Riza What else... • Food will be available. • Door Prize from sponsor will be available (waiting for details, I will update this soon) ","location":"To be confirmed, To be confirmed, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/NET-Developers-SG/events/219106052/","group_name":".NET Developers Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/NET-Developers-SG","formatted_time":"28 Jan 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-01-28T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-28T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"615301888599406","name":"ArtScience Late","description":" One Thursday a month, 7pm to 10pm Expression Gallery, Level 4 The full line-up of ArtScience Late until January 2015 can be viewed here:http://bit.ly/artsciencelate For one evening a month, ArtScience Museum transforms into a night-time platform for artists in the fields of performance and new media to experiment, explore, discover and challenge their artistic boundaries.
