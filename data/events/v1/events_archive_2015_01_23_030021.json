See you there! Free pizza is served before the talks. - Talk description This week, the topic for discussion is Functional Programming with Scala. Functional programming is a recent buzz word in the industry. Functional programming involves constructing programs using only pure functions with no side effects such as reading from files or mutating memory. This idea of functional programming, leads to a very different way of writing programs than you may be used to. We therefore start from the very beginning, relearning how to write the simplest of programs in a functional way. We will cover what is functional programming, its benefits and how pure functions can be built to achieve almost all of the regular tasks involved in programming. We will also look at basic Scala syntax and functional programming constructs. We will talk briefly about modelling state-ful programs using pure functions in Scala. - Speaker profile Sundaravalli Shriram, working as a Solutions architect with Paypal Singapore. She has around 16 years of experience in software development. She started her career in India working on C++, VC++.

The value of getting your hands dirty and especially learning from mistakes is often overlooked. The presentation that you see is often the result of many rounds of scrubbing. The speaker will share some of the common mistakes that he has observed and provide a glimpse of the working drafts before they were scrubbed and polished. He will also talk about the critical success factors that will make or break Analytics implementation. 8:30 pm: Closing and networking. More details on the talk will be updated.

Speaker Bio: Who would think that a exchange student would develop a winter product after just being on exchange in a winter country. But 3 years back, Charmain Tan did so. She invented and commercialized a winter touchscreen gloves as she could not use her newly bought iphone in the midst of the winter. It was indeed a great innovation as validated by the various international awards (eg. Red Dot Design Award, International Invention Award-Gold) that her company acclaimed for the invention. But great innovation needs to be coupled with great sales for the growth of a company. Hence as she was enroute to starting her second, she wanted to build something that could help companies increase their sales so entrepreneurs would not walk the same path that she did. Together with some great partners who are talented at Sales, Operations and Technology respectively, she started her second earlier this year Register Now!

In 2012, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to research on genetically induced adult stem cells for “advancing therapy”. This has led to the unprecedented growth in the arena of regenerative medicine using patients’ own cells. As we see a dwindling number of approved small molecule drugs and rising promises of biologics, can we ride on the wave of cell therapy as the next blockbuster or personalised therapeutics? Biotech Connection Singapore brings you a panel of key opinion figures in the Singapore cell therapy community, as we discuss the opportunities and challenges of translating stem cell research into clinical applications.    \n-          Are our technologies ready to develop the ideal candidate for cell-based therapy possessing characteristics such as accessibility, ease of scaling up, long tern safety profile and autologous in nature, etc? \n-          In terms of business models, is Singapore going to stagnate at the level of cord blood banking instead of leading the frontier of cell therapy?  \n-          Japan, Korea and China have emerged as the strong contenders in the development of cell therapy. Is our regulatory framework sufficiently established to administer cell therapy trials locally?  \n-          How do we prevent non-compliant clinical practices which put desperate patients at risks? \n  \nProgramme \n6:30 – 7:00 PM               Registration \n 7:00 – 7:10 PM               BCS & Speaker Introduction   \n7:10 – 8:30 PM               Panel Discussion and Q&A   \n8:30 – 9:30 PM               Networking Reception \n  \nOur Speakers \n  \nProf. James Hui  \nHead & Senior Consultant, Division of Paediatric Orthopaedics \nDirector, Cartilage Repair Program, National University Health System, Singapore \n  \n  \n  \nProf. James Hui specializes in the management of orthopaedic problems in children, as well as general orthopaedics.
