This week we'll be covering the chapters on NoSQL and ZeroMQ. At the end of each week's meetup we will take a vote to select ~two chapters from any of the three AOSA Volumes available. If there's a particular chapter you want us to cover, attend the next meetup and cast your vote!  \"If you are a junior developer, and want to learn how your more experienced colleagues think, these books are the place to start. If you are an intermediate or senior developer, and want to see how your peers have solved hard design problems, these books can help you too.\" How Book Club Works1. Read the chapter before you come to the meetup.2. Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting.4. Group discussion and banter ensues!

However things are now back on track and we have a meetup this month and we will also have a meetup earlier than usual in November as part of DevFest Singapore. The announcement for that will go out within a week and we will have our first international speaker talking about ClojureScript at that.  This time we're back with tales from the real world, where The Brave and True have deployed Clojure in anger successfully. We have 2 speakers and promise stimulating and true stories of the successes and issues around using Clojure in high performance, high availability and mission critical software. One of the most difficult things in getting your shop or workplace to adopt a new language is being able to figure out what it does well and what it does not. It's always a bit of a chicken and egg situation as to be able to do it you have to have done it already so benefit from the experience of our two speakers Liu Dapeng and Marcus Bradstreet to help you. The talks are: \"The Clojure brain behind 40 billion requests a day, a story of deploying clojure into production\" by Liu Dapeng. Dapeng is a software developer of 10 years experience who has been using Clojure for three years. He has built and deployed a key component of his employer's, PocketMath, ad management system in clojure and this is that story with comparisons to Java, how clojure worked and didn't, the unexpected  wins and losses including time travelling and the challenges of getting a new language accepted by his management. \n\n\n\n\"Clojure Embraces Pragmatism\" by Lucas Bradstreet. Lucas is a software developer of many moons and has been working with Clojure for more than 2 years. His talk is about the how Clojure is a language for getting stuff done primarily and not proving academic or style points. His talk will demonstrate how Clojure is more than any other language a language for developers who care about shipping product. ThoughtWorks have kindly stepped up and offered their offices for the meetup on Amoy St.  PocketMaths are kindly sponsoring the Pizza and drinks.","location":"ThoughtWorks office, 87B Amoy Street, Level 3, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup/events/226155840/","group_id":18616301,"group_name":"Singapore Clojure Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup","formatted_time":"28 Oct 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-10-28T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-28T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"225747072","name":"Virtual Reality TL;DR with OSVR Demo","description":" For this meetup, we expect guests from OSVR (Open Source Virtual Reality) with their high end Hacker Kit.

There are absolutely no fees. Just come with an open mind and willingness to share and learn Agenda:  Introduction &amp; Networking : 15 mins News Bytes : 15 mins Attacks and Defenses on SOHO routers (45 mins) by Lyon Yang.  Abstract of the talk(s): 1. News BytesIt will cover the latest news on information security that were in headlines in last month. 2. Attacks and Defenses on SOHO routers In this talk we will look into how a series of 0-day vulnerabilities can be used to hack into tens of thousands of SOHO Routers. We will elaborate on the techniques that were used in this research to locate exploitable routers, discover 0day vulnerabilities and successfully exploit them on both the MIPS and ARM platforms.  Speaker(s) Bio: Lyon Yang is a senior security consultant at Vantage Point Security with a research focus on embedded systems hacking and exploitation. He is from sunny Singapore, the world’s first smart city. His regular discoveries of zero days in a variety of router models has earned him a reputation as the go-to guy for router hacking in Singapore, where he has been hired to do firmware source code reviews on popular router models. He is currently working on a comprehensive testing framework for ARM and MIPS based routers as well as shell code generation and post-exploitation techniques.

We have come out with this special event with PayPal and invited Douglas to give a talk to the SingaporeJS community! Upgrading the Web  The web was originally imagined to be a simple distributed document retrieval system. It is now being used for applications that go far beyond the system's original capabilities and intentions. We have found ways to make it work, but they are difficult and far too fragile. Many times companies have offered to replace the web with superior proprietary systems, but we rejected them. We have been adding features to the web, but this does little to correct the deep underlying deficiencies, increasing instead of reducing its complexity. This talk suggests a way forward, taking inspiration from our successful transition from NTSC to HDTV. There is a way forward to a web that is safer, easier, and as good as we desire. Douglas Crockford is best known for his ongoing involvement in the development of the JavaScript language, for having popularized JSON, and for developing various JavaScript tools such as JSLint and JSMin.

These principles help reduce the cost, time and risk of delivering changes, and ultimately value, to customers by allowing for more incremental changes to applications in production. Continuous integration (CI) is the practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. In the same vein, the practice of continuous delivery further extends CI by making sure the software checked in on the mainline is always in a state that can be deployed to users and makes the actual deployment process very rapid. So, in this rapid and fast world of CI-CD, focusing on highly scalable &amp; highly portable software landscape, which offers high usage oriented web apps, the security landscape has really reached to cutting edge point. This talk, will focus on how to posturize security with this fast pace world, covering most of all security verticals.
