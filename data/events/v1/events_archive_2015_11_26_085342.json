These principles help reduce the cost, time and risk of delivering changes, and ultimately value, to customers by allowing for more incremental changes to applications in production. Continuous integration (CI) is the practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. In the same vein, the practice of continuous delivery further extends CI by making sure the software checked in on the mainline is always in a state that can be deployed to users and makes the actual deployment process very rapid. So, in this rapid and fast world of CI-CD, focusing on highly scalable &amp; highly portable software landscape, which offers high usage oriented web apps, the security landscape has really reached to cutting edge point. This talk, will focus on how to posturize security with this fast pace world, covering most of all security verticals.
