This time, I'm going to try another theme, inspired and adapted from Agile Conference 2014 . Open Space Theme: Working with Customers This theme focuses on: 1) How to identify and engage your customers - internal users, external clients, product managers, project sponsors etc.. Each of these groups have different needs and building a product without engaging each of them can be disastrous. 2) How to build the “right product”, how to validate and ensure that we are actually delivering value to our customers.
