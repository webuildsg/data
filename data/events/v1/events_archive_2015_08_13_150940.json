Clarence Tauro from CouchBase will be traveling to Singapore on that week and will be our guest speaker. We have interviewed Clarence here. Abstract NoSQL databases offer a significant change to how enterprise applications are built, challenging to two-decade hegemony of relational databases. The question people face is whether NoSQL databases are an appropriate choice, either for new projects or to introduce to existing projects. This talk will give a rapid introduction to NoSQL databases: where they came from, the nature of the data models they use, and the different way you have to think about consistency and polyglot persistence. It will then dive into Couchbase, which is a high-performance NoSQL distributed database with a flexible data model. Finally it will discuss how to integrate CouchBase with Spring using the Spring Data Couchbase project.  ============================================Note: if you are interested to go for CouchBase training in Singapore, all information is available here:  http://training.couchbase.com/class/for-developers/cd220-developing-couchbase-nosql-applications/singapore-central-singapore/2015a","location":"PayPal office in Suntec, 5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, 038985 Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/224470403/","group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"20 Aug 2015, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-20T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"224445724","name":"DSSG Aug Meetup - DataRobot","description":"This month, we are proud to have Xavier &amp; Jeremy from DataRobot to do a deep dive into data modeling.  (More details coming soon~) Xavier &amp; Jeremy are among the best data scientists in the world, winning multiple Kaggle competitions: • https://www.kaggle.com/xavierconort • https://www.kaggle.com/users/9441/jeremy-achin Agenda: • 7.00pm - 7.15pm: Networking • 7.15pm - 8.15pm: Presentation by DataRobot. • 8.15pm - 8.30pm: Closing and Networking.","location":"#03-04, IDA Labs@NDC 111 Middle Road, National Design Centre, Singapore 188969., IDA Labs@NDC 111 Middle Road, National Design Centre","url":"http://www.meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore/events/224445724/","group_name":"DataScience SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore","formatted_time":"20 Aug 2015, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-20T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"1563358550577683","name":"ArtScience Late","description":"[TICKETS SOLD OUT!] \nRyoji Ikeda: Supercodex\nThursday 20 August, 8pm\nArtScience Museum, Level 4\n\nConcept, composition: Ryoji Ikeda\nComputer graphics, programming: Tomonaga Tokuyama\n\nPREPARE TO BE IMMERSED IN A MULTI-SENSORIAL EXTRAVAGANZA.\n\nSonic artist, visual artist, electronic composer and computer-musician in one, Ryoji Ikeda has gained international renown for his provocative work combining visuals and sound.\n\nArtScience Museum is delighted to host the performance of Ikeda’s supercodex [live set], which reworks musical concepts from Ikeda’s 2013 superposition piece, which investigates how we understand the reality of nature on an atomic scale, taking its starting point in mathematical models and quantum mechanics. supercodex [live set] begins subtly, with digital noise, blips and bass drones, from which gradually emerges the core elements of techno and dance music, where Ikeda uses raw data and mathematical models to generate music and projections. \n\nDon’t miss this extraordinary live performance, where the accompanying visuals add to the rich textures to merge the senses, creating an unforgettable experience. \n\nFor more information please visit: http://www.ryojiikeda.com/archive/concerts/#supercodex_live_set\n\nPart of the Soundislands Festival\nhttp://soundislands.com/si15/","location":"ArtScience Museum","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1563358550577683","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/156726297714355","formatted_time":"20 Aug 2015, Thu, 8:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-20T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-20T14:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"814514632001443","name":"Friday Hacks #94: Welcome Tea & The Creation of NUSWhispers","description":"Friday Hacks are back for this new academic year! \n\nPlease join us in our Welcome Tea, where our president will share about what we do, the importance of fostering hacker culture in NUS and how to hack life!\n\nThe folks behind the popular NUSWhispers, Yang Shun, Erin, Yichen & Melvin will then reveal the story behind NUSWhispers, NUS's largest anonymous sharing portal with over 15,000 active users!\n\nAll freshmen & current students from all faculties are welcome to attend.

This time we  will be discussing how we going to apply Virtual Reality technology to Advertising and Virtual Retail. Imagine the possibility of setting up storefront just like how we create websites like html now. So as, hire a virtual shopkeeper for your virtual storefront. Imagine the possibility to curate a virtual building of all the rooms, just like orchard road. Each room is a virtual shop in the building. Imagine the possibility to bring your possible customer to place or experience that you want them to experience to advertise your product. Such as taking your customer to taste a glimpse of Japan before showing them the Japan tour package. The $22tn retail industry is for us, the Virtual Reality Enthusiast to explore and set pace. Being able to simulate the real shopping experience whilst in the comfort of their own home is another big step from the present online shopping experiences.  And for marketers looking to VR / AR as a way of delivering richer brand experiences, we’ll look at examples from Nissan, Castrol, Marriott Hotels, Dior and Patron. So let discuss and share about what can we, the VR Enthusiast brings to this market.
